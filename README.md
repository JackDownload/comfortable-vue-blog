# Serverless deployment with Netlify

Deploying your Blog with Netlify is perfect if you don't want to handle a server or webspace yourself. You'll be provided with a really fast and reliable deployment and hosting for any static website.

Using Netlify for this example is as simple as clicking the following button. You'll be asked to connect your GitHub or GitLab account to let Netlify create a Repository on your behalf.

That's all. Your Blog will be available within seconds. ðŸš€ ðŸ˜Š
